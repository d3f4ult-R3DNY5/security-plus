### Summary 
---
##### Social Engineering Basics  
- Exploits human psychology instead of technical flaws.  
- Goal: trick individuals into giving access, information, or action.  

##### Key Techniques  
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails to steal info.  
  - **Vishing**: Phone-based phishing.  
  - **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Impersonates executives/vendors.  
  - **Pretexting**: Fake scenarios to extract info.  
  - **Watering hole**: Compromise sites commonly visited by targets.  
  - **Brand impersonation**: Fake sites or messages mimicking trusted brands.  
  - **Typosquatting**: Fake domains with minor misspellings.  
- **Misinformation/Disinformation**: False info spread for manipulation.  
- **Impersonation**: Acting as trusted individuals to gain access.  

##### Password Attacks  
- **Brute-force**: Repeated attempts with many username/password combos.  
- **Spraying**: Uses common passwords across many accounts.  
##### TL;DR  
Social engineering manipulates people, not systems.  
Know phishing variants, impersonation, misinformation, and typosquatting.  
Brute-force = try all combos; spraying = common passwords across accounts.  

#### Social Engineering Techniques  
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails to steal information.  
  - **Smishing**: SMS/text-based phishing.  
  - **Vishing**: Voice/phone-based phishing.  
- **Misinformation/Disinformation**: Used to shift opinions and narratives.  
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be trusted individuals for access or info.  
- **Pretexting**: Fake but believable scenarios, often paired with impersonation.  
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Executive/vendor impersonation in emails.  
- **Brand impersonation**: Fake emails/sites mimicking trusted brands.  
- **Watering hole**: Compromise websites that targets frequently visit.  
- **Typosquatting**: Fake domains exploiting user typos.  

#### Password Attacks  
- **Online attacks**: Against live systems.  
- **Offline attacks**: Using stolen password stores.  
- **Brute-force**: Trying many combinations until success.  
- **Spraying**: Common passwords across many accounts.  
- **Dictionary attacks**: Use lists of known words/passwords.  
- **Password cracking**: Exploiting weak or improperly stored passwords.  
- **Weak storage risks**: Plain-text passwords or insecure hashes (e.g., MD5).  


#### TL;DR  
Social engineering = phishing variants, impersonation, misinformation, watering hole, typosquatting.  
Password attacks = brute-force, spraying, dictionary, cracking, worse if passwords are weakly stored.
