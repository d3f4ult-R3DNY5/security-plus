### Public cloud 
---
- Public cloud service providers deploy infrastructure and then make it accessible to any customers who wish to take advantage of it in a **multitenant model.**
- supports IaaS, FaaS, PaaS and SaaS services to their customer 
- They use multiple customers on the same cloud infra that is set off premises 

### Private Cloud 
---
- The term private cloud is used to describe any cloud infrastructure that is **provisioned for use by a single customer** 
- The key distinction here is that only **one customer uses the environment.**

### community cloud 
---
- A community cloud services  shares the charteristics of bothe the public and private models. 
- Community cloud services do run in a multitenant environment, but the tenants are **limited to members of a specifically designed community**
- It is mostly based on the shared mission , goal , compliace requirements and set of policies 

### Hybrid cloud 
---
- It is used to describe all cloud models blend public, private, and/or community cloud services together.
- Hybrid clouds require the use of technology that unifies the different cloud offerings into a single coherent platform
- It helps organisation to move away from the **centralised approach** and shift towards the more **decentralised approach**, This inturn helps to achieve the geographic dispersion that can occur 

### Share responsibility model
---
- cybersecurity work in a cloud-centric environment is quite similar to **on-premises cybersecurity.**
- cloud security operations also differ significantly from on- premises environments because **cloud customers must divide responsibilities between one or more service providers** and **the customers' own cybersecurity teams.** This is what is known as a shared responsibiity model 
- The shared responsibility model is achieved through **a shared matrix**

- This is nothing compared to the IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
	- IaaS : the consumer takes responsbility of the configuration and the type of hardware that is needed by the organsiation and the SP is responsible for maintaining it 
	- PaaS : the vendor also takes on responsibility for the operating system, whereas the customer retains responsibility for the data being placed into the environment and configuring its security.
	- SaaS : the provider takes on almost all security responsibility.
