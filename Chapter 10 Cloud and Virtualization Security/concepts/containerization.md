### containerization
---
> [!note]
> - Containers **provide application-level virtualization.**
> - They **require their own OS , own configs and package application that can be treated as units of virtualisation that become portable across the OS and the hardware platforms** 

> [!example] Processes 
> - One of the most popular way of implementing this is through the use of **docker images within the system and the server**
> - **Isolation** must be enforced between the containers
