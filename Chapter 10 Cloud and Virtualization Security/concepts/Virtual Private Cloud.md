### Virtual Private Cloud
---
Segmentation is one of the key concepts **when it comes to security of networks** . Segmentation allows network engineers to **place systems of differing security levels and functions on different network subnets.**

### Working and process
---
>[!note]
>- On a physical network, networking and security professionals use **virtual LAN (VLAN) technology to achieve segmentation.**
>- In cloud environments **virtual private clouds (VPCs) serve the same purpose**
>- It allows teams to group **systems into subnets and designate those subnets as public or private**
>- Cloud providers also offer VPC endpoints that allow the connection of VPCs to each other using the **cloud provider's secure network backbone.**
>- **Cloud transit gateways** extend this model even further, allowing the direct interconnection of cloud VPCs with on-premises VLANs for hybrid cloud operations.
