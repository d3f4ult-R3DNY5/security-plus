## Cloud Security Issues
---
The cloud brings tremendous operational and financial advantages to organizations, but those advantages also come with **new security issues that arise in cloud environments.**


### 1. Availability 
---
>[!note]
>1. Benefit is that cloud operates in different location 
>2. operates in high availability modes and have redundancy 


### 2. Data Sovereignty 
---
>[!note]
> 1. The distributed nature of cloud computing involves the use of geographically distant facilities to **achieve high availability and to place content in close proximity to users.**
> 2. Data sovereignty is a principle that states that data is subject to the l**egal restrictions of any jurisdiction where it is collected, stored, or processed**. This might involve having data in  jusridiction your not afffiated with.
> 3. Security professionals responsible for managing cloud services should be certain that they understand how their **data is stored, processed, and transmitted across jurisdictions**
> 4. Some cloud providers offer explicit control over the **use of resources in specific regions.**


### 3. VM Security 
---
>[!note]
>1. Virtual machine (VM) escape vulnerabilities are the most serious issue that can exist in a virtualized environment, particularly when a v**irtual host runs systems of differing security levels.** Hypervisor is responsible for this 
>2. Virtual machine sprawl occurs when IaaS users **create virtual service and abandon them leving them to accumulate costs**
>3. Resource reuse occurs when cloud providers take **hardware resources that were originally assigned to one customer and reassign them to another customer.**

### 4. App security 
---
>[!note]
>1. Cloud applications depend heavily on the **use of APIs to provide service integration and interoperability.** So it is necessary to protect the API 
>2. Secure web gateways (SWGs) also provide a **layer of application security for cloud-dependent organizations.** This is done by validating the requests of the internal users and evaluating them against the security policies of the organisation 

### 5. Governance and audits by Third party 
---
>[!note]
>1. Vetting vendors being **considered for cloud partnerships.**
>2. **Managing vendor relationships and monitoring for early warning signs of vendor stability issues**
>3. **Overseeing an organization's portfolio of cloud activities**
>4. **Auditability is an important component of cloud governance.** Cloud computing contracts should include language guaranteeing the right of the customer to audit cloud service providers.
