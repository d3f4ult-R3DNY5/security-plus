>[!note]
>Cloud computing can be an intimidating term, but the fundamental idea is straightforward: **cloud service providers deliver computing services to their customers over the Internet**


According to NIST cloud computing is a model that **allows ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources**. This resources can be provisioned with minimal management 

> Most of the **cloud** resources are on demand

Key benefits of cloud computing 
- subscription model : pay as you go model 
- multitenancy : same physical computing environment may house workloads of different customers 
- rapid provisioning of resources
