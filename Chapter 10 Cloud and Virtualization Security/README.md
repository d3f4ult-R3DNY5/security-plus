### Summary 
---
#### Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity  

Cloud computing changes the cybersecurity landscape.  
Although cybersecurity professionals still must implement controls that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems, they now do so in an environment that requires the cooperation of cloud service providers.  

Under the **shared responsibility model** of cloud security, cloud customers and providers must come to a common understanding of who will be responsible for meeting each security control requirement.  

#### Implementing Cloud Security Controls  

Organizations adopting cloud security controls may choose to implement:  
- **Cloud-native security controls** offered by their providers.  
- **Third-party controls** that work across a variety of environments.  
- **Hybrid approaches**, using a mixture of both.  

They may also implement **cloud access security brokers (CASBs)** that allow the consistent enforcement of security policies across diverse cloud platforms.  


#### Cloud-Specific Vulnerabilities  

Organizations should understand the vulnerabilities that appear in cloud environments.  
These include:  
- **Virtualization issues**, such as virtual machine escape and resource reuse.  
- **Data sovereignty concerns**, which arise when using cloud services located in different jurisdictions.
