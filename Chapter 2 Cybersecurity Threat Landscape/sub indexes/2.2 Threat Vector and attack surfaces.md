## **Threat Vector and attack surfaces**
---
Threat actors targeting an organization need some means to gain access to that **organization's information or systems.** 

1. Attackers must discover an **attack surface**
2. attackers must uncover some **vulnerability,weakness or a risk** in a system that they can exploit 
3. They must obtain access by exploiting one of the vulnerabilities in a system. This is done using a **threat vector**


### Types of threat vectors 


#### Message-Based Threat Vectors
---
>[!info]
>- **Email** is one of the most commonly exploited threat vectors.
>- **Phishing** is one of the simple ways to gain access to an organization's network
>- attackers only need to **win once**
>- Attacks can be conducted through **SMS** or **IM**
>- Voice call can be used to carry out attacks AKA **vishing**



#### Wired networks 
---
>[!info]
>- Bold attackers may attempt to gain network access by **physically entering the facility**
>- Can be done by **entering the public areas** such as cafe, restrooms and lobby 
>-  may find **unsecured computer terminal or a network decice**

>[!tip]
>Must assume that anyone who can **physically access these devices can compromise the entire system** 


#### Wireless Networks
---
>[!info]
>- **easier than physical access to the system**
>- the attackers must be just **within the range** of the network
>- includes **bluetooth and Wi-Fi technologies**

>[!tip]
>**Unsecured or poorly secured** wireless network configs pose a security risk


#### Systems
---
>[!info]
>- **individual systems** may also serve as threat vectors depending on their **config** and the **software installed**.
>- **open service ports** and **default credentials** is a security risk
>- **legacy applications** pose a security threat
