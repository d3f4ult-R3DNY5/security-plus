>[!info]
>- . Confidence scores allow organizations to filter and use threat intelligence based on **how much trust they can give it**

>[!tip]
>- **low confidence scores** shouldn't be completely ignored but it **shouldn't be relied to make important decision**

>[!example] Steps Involved
>1. Confirmed (90–100) uses independent sources or **direct analysis** to prove that the threat is real.
>2. Probable (70–89) relies on **logical inference** but does not directly confirm the threat.
>3. Possible (50–69) is used when **some information agrees with the analysis**, but the assessment is not confirmed.
>4. Doubtful (30-49) is assigned when the assessment is made possible but is not the most likely option
>5. Improbable (2–29) means that the assessment is **possible but is not a logical approach**
>6. Discredited (1) : **inaccurate information**
