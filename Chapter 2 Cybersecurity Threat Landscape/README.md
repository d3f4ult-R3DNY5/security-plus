### Summary 
---

**Threat Landscape Basics**
- Cybersecurity professionals must understand threats to assess risks and apply controls.
- Threats can be classified by:
    - **Origin**: internal vs. external.
    - **Skill Level**: unskilled to highly advanced.
    - **Resources**: low to well-funded.
    - **Intent/Motivation**: financial gain, political goals, disruption, etc.

**Types of Threat Actors**

- **Unskilled attackers**: motivated by thrill.
- **Nation-state actors**: use cyberattacks for political/military advantage.
- **Hacktivists**: politically or socially motivated.
- **Organized crime**: financially motivated.
- **Competitors**: may attempt corporate espionage.

**Threat Vectors**

- **Common**: email, social media.
- **Others**: physical access, supply chain compromise, network attacks.

**Defense Approach**

- Develop **threat intelligence programs** to track and respond to emerging threats.

**TL;DR**  
- Know the threat types, sources, and motives.  
- Watch main attack paths: email, social media, physical, supply chain, network.  
- Use threat intelligence to stay ahead.

**Threat Actor Classification**
1. **Origin**: Internal vs. external.
2. **Skill level**: Unskilled to highly advanced.
3. **Resources**: Low-budget to well-funded.
4. **Motivation**: Financial, political, revenge, chaos, war, ethics, etc.

**Types of Threat Actors**

- **Unskilled attackers**: use prewritten exploits.
- **Nation-state actors**: advanced persistent threats, often political/military.
- **Organized crime**: financially motivated.
- **Hacktivists**: political or ideological agendas.
- **Competitors**: espionage for financial gain.
- **Insiders**: employees or contractors exploiting access.
- **Shadow IT**: unauthorized systems introducing risk.    

**Attack Motivations**

- Data theft, espionage, disruption, blackmail, financial gain, ideology, revenge, chaos, war.

**Attack Vectors**

- Internet, wireless, physical access.
- Social engineering via email/social media.
- Malicious removable media.
- Cloud service exploitation.
- Supply chain compromise.

**Threat Intelligence**

- Sources: open-source, private, internal research    
- Tools: indicators of compromise, predictive analytics.
- Purpose: detect, predict, and respond to threats.


**Supply Chain Security**

- Risks in hardware, software, and cloud vendors.    
- Mitigation: vendor management, monitoring outsourced development, cloud data storage security, and externalâ€“internal integrations.

**TL;DR**  
- Threat actors vary by origin, skill, resources, and motives.  
- Attacks come via networks, wireless, physical, social, media, cloud, and supply chain.  
- Use threat intelligence to detect and predict attacks.  
- Secure the supply chain with strict vendor management.
