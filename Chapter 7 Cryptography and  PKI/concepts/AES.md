### AES
---
>[!note]
>- Advanced Encryption Standard
>- NIST released Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 197, which **mandated the use of AES/Rijndael for the encryption of all sensitive but unclassified data by the U.S. government.**
>- Had 3 key strength that is 128, 192 and 256 bits but processed blocks that is equal to the key length 
>	- 128-bit keys require 10 rounds of encryption.
>	- 192-bit keys require 12 rounds of encryption.
>	- 256-bit keys require 14 rounds of encryption.
>- Plays an essential role in **wireless network security , TLS , File encryption etc**
