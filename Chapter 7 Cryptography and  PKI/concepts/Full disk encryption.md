### Full disk encryption
---
>[!note]
>- This also known as **FDE** 
>- where **all the data on a hard drive is automatically encrypted**, including the operating system and system files.
>- In **case of loss of theft prevent unauthorized access to all data on the hard drive**

>[!caution]
>Once the system is booted, **the entire disk is accessible, which means data is vulnerable if system gets compromised**


### Implementation 
---
>[!note]
>- This can be implemented at the hardware level using a **self encrypting drive** 
>- This method makes use of an encryption key which  based on the 
>	- token
>	- security key 

>[!caution]
>- If the encryption key is lost it becomes diifcult to withdraw the data
