### Hash Functions
---
This is used to verify the integrity of the data being sent 

>[!example] working
>- They take a **potentially long message and generate a unique output** value derived from the **content of the message.**
>- This value is commonly referred to as a **message digest**

Message digests can be **generated by the sender of a message and transmitted to the recipient** along with the full message for **two reasons.**

>[!tip] First reason
>The recipient can use the same hash function to recompute the message digest from the full message. Then can be used to compare the message sent by the originator to **check if the message is not modified in transit** 

>[!tip] Second Reason
>It could be use to implement a digital signature algorithm 


### Requirements of the hash function 
---
- They accept an input of any length
- They produce O/P of fixed length 
- The hash value is relatively easy to compute 
- The hash function is one way 
- A secure hash function is collision free 

### Types of hashing algorithms 
---
1. [SHA](SHA.md)
2. [MD5](MD5.md)
