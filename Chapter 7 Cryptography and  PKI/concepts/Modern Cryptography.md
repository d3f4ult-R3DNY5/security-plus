### Modern Cryptography
---
>[!note]
>Modern cryptosystems use computationally **complex algorithms and long cryptographic keys** to meet the **cryptographic goals of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation.**

### Cryptographic Secrecy 
---
Some cryptographers thought the best way to keep an encryption algorithm secure was **to hide the details of the algorithm from outsiders.**

>[!important]
>In fact, the algorithms for most cryptographic systems are widely available for **public review and scrutinity** which allows the security researchers to discover the flaws and resolve them.

The **length of a cryptographic key is an extremely important factor in determining the strength of the cryptosystem** and the **likelihood that the encryption will not be compromised through cryptanalytic techniques.**

Modern cryptographic systems use **at least a 128-bit key** to protect data against prying eyes.
