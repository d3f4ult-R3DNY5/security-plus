### Symmetric key Management
---
>[!note]
>cryptographic keys contain information essential to the security of the cryptosystem, Therefore **security measures must be taken to securely distribute the keys**.
>
>They include the safeguards against creation, distribution, storage, destruction, recovery and routing and escrow of secret keys 

### 1. Creation and Distribution of keys 
---
> **Key exchange** is one of the major problems underlying **symmetric encryption algorithms.**

### 2. Storage and Destruction of Symmetric Keys
---
>Another major challenge with the use of symmetric key cryptography is that **all of the keys used in the cryptosystem must be kept secure**
