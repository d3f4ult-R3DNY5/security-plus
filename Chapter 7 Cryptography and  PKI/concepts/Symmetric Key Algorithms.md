### Symmetric Key Algorithms
---
>[!note]
>**Symmetric key algorithms rely on a “shared secret” encryption key that is distributed to all the participating members** in the communication. 

This key is used to bot encrypt and decrypt the message.

### Processs

>[!example] working
>The sender encrypts with the shared secret key and the receiver decrypts with it

When **large-sized keys are used, symmetric encryption** is very difficult to break

- They are used only in **bulk encryption and only provide for confidentiality**

### Weaknesses 
---
- **Sharing the key** becomes a problem 
- It doesnt include **non -repudiation**
- The algorithm is **not-scalable**
- **The keys must be regenerated often**
	- if a participating memeber leaves all the keys that is known by him must be discarded 

### Pro 
---
- High speed in encryption
