### Cryptographic Keys
---
>[!info]
>- All cryptographic algorithm**s rely on keys to maintain their security.**
>- Each key belongs to a **Key Space** which is 0 to 2^n
>- A key space is defined by its **key length** denoted by n


### Kerchoff's Principle

Kerckhoffsâ€™ principle is that a cryptographic system should be secure even if **everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.**
