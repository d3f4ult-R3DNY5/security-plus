### Goal of confidentiality
---
The main motive behind this goal is to ensure confidentiality of the [CIA Triad](../../Chapter%201%20Today's%20Security%20Professional/concepts/CIA%20Triad.md)

This means protecting  
- **[data at rest](data%20at%20rest.md)** 
- **[data in transit](data%20in%20transit.md)** 
- **[data in use](data%20in%20use.md)** 

This goal can be achieved via 
- **Symmetric cryptosystems** use a shared secret key available to all users of the cryptosystem
- **Asymmetric cryptosystems** use individual combinations of public and private keys for each user of the system.
