### MD5
---
>[!note]
>- MD5 is the message digest 5 
>- This was developed by Ron Rivest 
>- . It also processes **512-bit blocks of the message**, but **it uses four** **distinct rounds of computation to produces digest of the same length** as the earlier MD2 and MD4 algorithms
>- Computation is reduce but researchers have demonstrated that the **MD5 is subject to collision**
