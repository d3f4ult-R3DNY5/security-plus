### SHA
---
>[!note]
>- Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), and its successors, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3
>- The are standard hash functions **developed by the Govt and approved by the NIST**  
>- SHA-1 takes an **input of virtually any length and produces a 160-bit message digest.**
>- It process the message in blocks of 512 if the message doesnt fit it is padded till it reaches the next multiple of 512 
>- SHA1 is weak to **Cryptanalytic attacks**
>- SHA-256 and SHA-254 use 512 bit blocks 
>- SHA-512 and SHA-384 use 1024 but blocks
