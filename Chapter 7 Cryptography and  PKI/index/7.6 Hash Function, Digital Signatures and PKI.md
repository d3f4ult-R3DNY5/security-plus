### Hash Function, Digital Signatures and PKI

#### Hash Function 
---
Hash functions are used to verify the integrity of the data  that is being sent 

[Hash Functions](Hash%20Functions.md)

### Digital Signatures
---
Once a cryptographically sound hashing algorithm is chosen, you can use it to implement a digital signature system

[Digital Signatures](Digital%20Signatures.md)


### Public Key Infrastructre 
---
The major strength of public key encryption is its ability to **facilitate communication between parties previously unknown to each other.**
