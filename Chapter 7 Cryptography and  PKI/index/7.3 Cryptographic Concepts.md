### Cryptographic Concepts
---
Plain text 
- **Before a message is put into a coded** form
- denoted by **P**

Cipher Text 
- **sender of a message uses a cryptographic algorithm to encrypt the plain-text message**
- This us denoted by **C**

The first step in understanding Cryptography is Cryptographic keys

### Cryptographic Keys 
---
All cryptographic algorithms rely on keys to maintain their security.

[Cryptographic Keys](Cryptographic%20Keys.md)

### Ciphers 
---
Ciphers are the **algorithms used to perform encryption and decryption**.

[Types of modern ciphers](Types%20of%20modern%20ciphers.md)

### Modern Cryptography 
---
Modern cryptosystems use computationally **complex algorithms and long cryptographic keys** to meet the **cryptographic goals of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation.**

[Modern Cryptography](Modern%20Cryptography.md)

### Symmetric Key algorithms 
---
**Symmetric key algorithms rely on a “shared secret” encryption key that is distributed to all the participating members** in the communication. 

[Symmetric Key Algorithms](Symmetric%20Key%20Algorithms.md)

### Asymmetric Key algorithms 
---
Asymmetric key algorithms, also known as **public key algorithms**, provide a solution to the weaknesses of symmetric key encryption

[Asymmetric Key Algorithms](Asymmetric%20Key%20Algorithms.md)


### Hashing Algorithm
---
Message digests are **summaries of a message's content** produced by a hashing algorithm.

They are only vulnerable to 
- collisions
- deprecated hash functions
