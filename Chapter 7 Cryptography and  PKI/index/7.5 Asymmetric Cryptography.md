### Asymmetric Cryptography
---
>[!note]
>- This cryptosystem **rely on pairs of keys assigned to each user of the cryptosystem.**

>[!example] Working
>1. The sender encrypts the **plain-text message (P) with the recipient's public key to create the ciphertext message (C).** 
>2. When the **recipient opens the ciphertext message, they decrypt it using their private key to recreate the original plain-text message.**

Requires a **higher degree of Computational power** to achieve this .

>[!FAQ]
>**Why not use more longer keys to secure algorithm ?**
>
>Longer keys are certainly more secure **but they also require more computational overhead. It's the classic trade-off of resources versus security constraints**

### Key management 
---
Encryption System Selection

>[!tip]
>- Do not rely on “security through obscurity.” -
>- Use publicly available, peer-reviewed algorithms. -
>- Avoid “black-box” systems that rely on secret algorithms.

Key selection 

>[!tip]
>- Choose key length balancing security and performance. 
>- Ensure high entropy (true randomness).
>- Avoid weak or known vulnerable keys.

Private key Protection 

>[!tip]
>- Keep private key secret at all times.
>- Never share private keys.
>- Compromise of a private key allows full impersonation and decryption of all related communications.

Key Lifecycle Management 

>[!tip]
>- Retire keys after useful life.
>- Follow key rotation policies or change keys periodically.
>- Frequent key reuse increases exposure to cryptographic attacks.

Key Backup

>[!tip]
>- Maintain secure backups of private keys.
>- Protect against data loss from corruption or disaster.
>- Use personal backups or secure key escrow services.
>- Ensure backup storage security.

Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)

>[!tip] 
>- Use HSMs for secure key storage and management.
>- Prevent direct human access to keys.
