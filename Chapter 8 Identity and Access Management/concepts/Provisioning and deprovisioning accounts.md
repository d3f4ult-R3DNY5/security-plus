### Provisioning and deprovisioning accounts
---
#### Provision 
>[!note]
>- When accounts are created they are provisioned 
>- This also involves **identity proofing** meaning : that the **account is created for the person claiming accounts** could be done through PII
>- identity proofing is generally done during **employee onboarding**
>- It involves ensuring right **permission for the role** and should involve **POLP**

>[!caution]
>A key concern for organizations that manage permissions for users, groups, and roles over time is **permission creep**.
> 
>- Permission creep occurs when users take on new roles or are granted new permissions based on tasks they are doing.


Long-term permission management is a critical part of **identity and access management systems and processes, and permission management with a least privilege approach is a key security control.**


#### Deprovisioning 
>[!note]
>- This removes the **account, permissions, and related data, files or other artifacts** as required by the organization's processes and procedures
>- important step because it helps to ensure that **dormant accounts are not available for attackers to compromise or co-opt**
