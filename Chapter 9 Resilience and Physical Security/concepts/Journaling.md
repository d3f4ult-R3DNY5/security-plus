### Journaling
---
>[!notes]
>- This creates a **log of changes that can be reapplied** if an issue occurs.
>- Used in a variety of **Databases, VM's etc**

>[!caution]
>- A journal still needs to be **backed up somewhere else** 
>- Restoring **journaled transactions can slow down recovery processes** as the journal must be replayed and applied to the target dataset or system.
