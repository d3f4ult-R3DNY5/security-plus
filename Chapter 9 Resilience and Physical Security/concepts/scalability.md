### scalability
---
>[!note]
>Scalability is a common **design element and a useful response control for many systems in modern environments**, This is done to meet the growing demand of resources and services 


### vertical scalability 
---
>[!example] vertical scalability
>- Vertical scalability **requires a larger or more powerful system or device.**
>- Vertical scalability can help **when all tasks or functions need to be handled on the same system or infrastructure.** 
>- Vertical scalability **can be very expensive to increase**, particularly if the event that drives the need to **scale is not ongoing or frequent.**


### horizontal scalability 
---
>[!example] horizontal scalability
>- Horizontal scaling **uses smaller systems or devices but adds more of them**. 
>- When designed and managed correctly, a horizontally scaled system can **take advantage of the ability to transparently add and remove more resources, allowing it to adjust as needs grow or shrink**
