### Physical Security Controls
---
>[!note]
>While security practitioners often focus on technical controls, one of the most important lines of defense for an organization is the **set of physical controls that it puts in place.**


### 1. Site Security 
---
The first step in preventing physical access is by **implementing a site security plan**. Site security looks at the **entire facility or facilities used by an organization and implements a security plan** based on the threats and risk to those assets.

### 2. Guards 
---
Security guards are used in areas where human interaction is either necessary or helpful. Guards can make decisions that **technical control systems cannot, and they can provide additional capabilities by offering both detection and response capabilities.**
