## Architectural constraints and Security
---

##### 1. Availability 
>[!note]
>**targets should be set and designed for based on organization requirements** balanced against the other considerations.

##### 2. Resilience 
>[!note]
>component of availability that **determines what type and level of potential disruptions the service or system can handle** without availability issue 


##### 3. Cost 
>[!note]
>Finances, staffs and other cost 


##### 4. Responsiveness 
>[!note]
>The ability of a system to respond in timely manner 

##### 5. Scalability 
>[!note]
> The ability to scale vertically and horizontally to meet the goal of availability, resilience and ressponsiveness

##### 6. Ease of deployment 
>[!note]
>Describes the complexity and work needed that is used to deploy the systems 

##### 7. Risk Transference 
>[!note]
>The ability to transfer risks through insurance, contacts  and other means 

##### 8. Ease of Recovery 
>[!note]
>How easy it is to recover systems which highly depends on the ease of deployment factors 

##### 9. Patch availability 
>[!note]
>- dependent on **vendor support**
>- how **often will patching be required**

##### 10 . Inability to patch 
>[!note]
>- This is an important consideration when high availability is required 

##### 11. power consumption 
>[!note]
>- drives ongoing costs
