### Storage Resiliency
---
This could be done through the use of 
- [RAID Disks](../concepts/RAID%20Disks.md)
- [Backups](../concepts/Backups.md)
- [Replication](../concepts/Replication.md)
- [Journaling](../concepts/Journaling.md)

### Backup Frequency 
---
Backup frequency is another key design consideration. Some backups for **frequently changing data may need to be continuous**, such as for database transactions.
[Recovery Process](../concepts/Recovery%20Process.md)


### Snapshots 
---
A snapshot captures the full state of a system or device at the time the backup is completed.

[snapshots](../concepts/snapshots.md)

### Image 
---
They refer to a complete copy of a system or server, **typically down to the bit level for the drive**

[Images](../concepts/Images.md)

### Backup Media 
---
Backup media decisions involve **capacity, reliability, speed, cost, expected lifespan while storing data**, Like how often can the data be reused before wearing out and other factors, all of which can infulence the backup 

[Types of Backups](../concepts/Types%20of%20Backups.md)


### Decision regarding backups
---
Main question that should backups be done online and offline well , it easier to understand by trying to comprehend what type of data you are accessing.

### Cloud Backups 
---
Cloud backups like **Amazon's S3 Glacier and Google's Coldline Storage** **provide lower prices for slower access times** and provide what is essentially offline storage with a nearline access model.


### Offsite storage 
---
Some organisation choose to utilize off-site storage for their backup media
