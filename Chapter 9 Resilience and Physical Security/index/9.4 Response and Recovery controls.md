## Response and Recovery controls
---
When failures do occur, organizations need **to respond and then recover.** 

Response controls are controls used to allow **organizations to respond to an issue.**
- This could range from a **power outage to a disaster**

### 1. Concept of non persistence 
---
An important response control in that list is the concept of nonpersistence.
[concept of nonpersistence](../concepts/concept%20of%20nonpersistence.md)


### 2. Reversion to known states 
---
The **reversion to known states can also be made possible through snapshots**. This means reverting to the **last known good configurations** .
- In windows it would be a system restore 

### 3. Scalability 
---
When **loads on systems and services become high or when components in an infrastructure fail, organizations need a way to respond**

### 4. Site resiliency 
----
This has been historically a part of site considerations for organisations and for some it remains a critical design element

### What to do when you cant trust a system ?
---
Use a live boot media and mount and access the drives and the other devices . That means the repair efforts can be run from a known a good media.
