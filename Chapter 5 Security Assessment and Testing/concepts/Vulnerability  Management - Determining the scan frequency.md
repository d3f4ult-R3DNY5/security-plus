## Determining the scan frequency 
---
>[!note]
>- **Cybersecurity professionals** depend on automation to help them perform their duties in an **efficient, effective manner**.
>- **Vulnerability scanning** tools allow the automated scheduling of scans to take the **burden off administrators**.

***Tenable's nessus***  *product is one of the first vulnerability scanner on the market and remains on of the widely used scanners till date*

### Working 
---
>[!example] steps involved 
>- Administrators **automate the alerts** when they detect new vulnerabilities
>- Many of these scans are designed to perform the automated email reports 


### Factors affecting the scan
---
Some of the several factors that affect the scan are given as follows 
- **organisation risk apppetite** is its willingness to tolerate the risks within the environment 
- **regulatory requirements such as** PCI DSS and FISMA may detect the frequency of the vulnerability scans.
- **technical constrains** he scanning system may only be capable of performing a certain number of scans per day
- **business constrains** may limit the organisation from conducting resource-intensive vulnerability scans during periods of high business activity to **avoid disruptions to the business critical systems**
- **liscensing limitations** : to avoid the over consumption of bandwidth
