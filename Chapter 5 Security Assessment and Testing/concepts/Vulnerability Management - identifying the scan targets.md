## **Identifying the scan targets**
---
The identifying phase also involves several steps which are given as follows 

- Step 1 : They check whether any **regulatory requirements** apply to their scans
- Step 2 : is to **identify the systems** that will be covered by the **vulnerability scan** 
- Step 3 : Some organisation choose to cover **all the systems** in the scanning processes  whereas in certain cases only **some systems** are accessible  which depends on factors like 

>[!example] Factors affecting the systems that are being scanned 
>- **classification of the data** that is being stored or processed ?
>- is the system **internet facing or on semipublic** networks 
>- services provided by the system
>- what kind of system is being tested 

- Step 4 : Companies use **scanning tools**  to scan the network and also may perform an **asset inventory** 
- Step 5 : Admins may then **supplement this inventory** with additional information which may **affect the quality of the scans** 
- Step 6 : **Asset inventory** and **asset criticality information** helps guide decisions about the types of scans that are performed
