## Techniques Involved in Application Testing 
---
There are mainly 3 techniques that is involved in the testing process 


### Static testing 
---
>[!info]
>**TL DR** : analyzes code without executing it. 
>This approach points developers directly at vulnerabilities and often provides specific remediation suggestions

### Dynamic Testing 
---
>[!info]
>**TL DR** : Executes the code as a part of the testing process 
>Running the code with all the interfaces and checking for all possible inputs that can result as a vulnerability 

### Interactive Testing 
---
>[!info]
>**TL DR** : Combines static and dynamic testing 
>Testers have access to the source code and interact with the application through exposed interfaces
