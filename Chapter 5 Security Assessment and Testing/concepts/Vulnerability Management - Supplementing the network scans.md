## Supplementing the network scans

### Overview 
---
>[!info]
>- Basic vulnerability scans run over a network, pr**obing a system from a distance.** 
>- This provides a realistic view of the system's security by simulating **what an attacker might see from another network vantage point**

>[!note]
>However there are several obstructions that lie in the path of the network and the server 
>- firewalls 
>- IPS 
>- other security controls 
>This can provide an inaccurate view to the tester of the servers security independent of those controls.

### Key Observations 
---
>[!tip]
>Vulnerability scans that run over the network may detect the **possibility that a vulnerability exists but be unable to confirm it with confidence**


In such cases 
- Modern vulnerability solution can supplement the remotes scans about the **servers configurations**

This can be done by the following steps 
>[!example] Steps involved 
>- Step 1:  administrators can provide the scanner **with credentials** to the target server 
>- Step 2 : enforce the concept of least privilege by providing the scanner with a **read only account** 
>- Step 3: supplement the traditional server based scanning approach with the agent based scanning approach if the agents can handle the computation overhead
