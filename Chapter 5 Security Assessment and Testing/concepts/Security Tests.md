## Security Tests

### Overview 
---
>[!info]
>Security tests verify that a control is functioning properly. These tests include automated scans, tool-assisted penetration tests, and manual attempts to undermine security.

### Factors to be considered 
---
>[!example] Factors to be considered 
>- Availability of security testing resources
>- Criticality of system and the applications 
>- Likelihood of a technical failure mechanism 
>- Likelihood of a Misconfig 
>- Risk that the system will be under attack 
>- Rate of change of a control configuration 
>- Difficulty and time required to perform a control test 
>- impact on normal business operation

After assessing each of these factors, security teams design and validate a comprehensive assessment and testing strategy. 

>Some cases prefer the automated scans and may include less frequent manual test 

### Processes 
---
1. security professionals must conducted the test while keeping these factors in mind 
2. Analyse the review of those results 
3. Reporting 


### Responsible Disclosure Programs 
---
Responsible disclosure programs allow security researchers to securely share information about vulnerabilities in a product with the vendor responsible for that product.
