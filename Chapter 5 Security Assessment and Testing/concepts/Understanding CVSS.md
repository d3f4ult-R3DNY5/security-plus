## CVSS

### Overview 
---
>[!info]
>- Analysts scoring a new vulnerability begin by rating the vulnerability on **eight different measures.**
>- Each measure is given a descriptive and a numeric score 
>- First 4 measures evaluate the **exploitability of the vulnerability** 
>- Next 3 discuss the **impact of the vulnerability** 
>- Last 1 discusses the **scope of the vulnerability**
