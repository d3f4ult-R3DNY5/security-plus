## Configuring the vulnerability scans
---
The various ways that the scans can be configured is given down below

### 1. Scan sensitivity levels 
---
One of the major factor that must be kept in mind while performing this scans is 

>[!note]
>"*the scan meets its objectives while minimizing the possibility of disrupting the target environment*."

#### Steps involved 
---
>[!example] Steps Involved 
>- administrators create a new scan by beginning with a **template** which may be provided by the **security vendor and may be built into the product**
>- use **common configuration settings in templates** to allow efficient reuse of their work saving time , boosting efficiency and reducing the errors 
>- Admins can also improve the efficiency of the scans by configuring the **specific plugins** that will run during each scans 

Plugins can also be of two types 
- **intrusive plugins** : It directly interacts with the system and aims to exploit the vulnerabilities present in the system as when if possible 
- **non intrusive plugins** : It passively interacts with the system in hopes that it gathjers the information of the target that being scanned
