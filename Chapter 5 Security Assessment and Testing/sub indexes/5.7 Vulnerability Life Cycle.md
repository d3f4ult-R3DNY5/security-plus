### 1. Vulnerability Identification 
---
>[!note]
>the organization becomes **aware of a vulnerability that exists within their environment**

>[!example] Sources it can come from 
>- Vulnerability scans run by the organization or outside assessors
>- Penetration tests of the organization's environment
>- Reports from responsible disclosure or bug bounty programs
>- Results of system and process audits

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis 
---
After the vulnerability is detected then an analysis is performed on the vulnerability report 

>[!example] Core tasks 
>- Confirming that the vulnerability exists and is not the result of a False positive
>- Prioritizing and categorizing the vulnerability using tools such as CVSS and CVE 
>- Supplementing analysis of the vulnerability from the external sources 


### 3. Vulnerability Response and Remediation 
---
>[!note]
>The outcome of the vulnerability analysis should guide the organization t**o identify the vulnerabilities that are most in need of remediation.**

>[!example] The vulnerability can be remediated in the following ways 
>- Apply a patch or other corrective measure to correct the vulnerability.
>- using network segmentation 
>- implement compensating controls like application firewalls or IPS
>- puchase insurance to transfer the financial risk of a vulnerability to an insurance provider 
>- Grant an exception or exemption to the system as part of a formal risk acceptance stratergy 


### 4. Validation of remediation 
---
>[!note]
>After completing the vulnerability the remediation effort must ensure that the vulnerability is no longer present in the system 


### 5. Reporting
---
>[!note]
>Communicating the **findings the actions taken, and lessons learned** to relevant stakeholders within the organization.

>[!example] Reporting involves 
>- **Summarizing the vulnerabilities identified, analyzed, and remediated**, along with their **initial severity and impact on the organization**
>- Providing details on the **remediation actions taken, including patches applied, compensating controls implemented, and risk acceptance decisions** made
>- **Highlighting any trends, patterns, or areas** requiring further attention such as recurring vulnerabilities 
>- Offering the recommendation for improvements
