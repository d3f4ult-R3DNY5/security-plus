Passwords are the **most common form of authentication** in use today, but unfortunately, **they are also the most easily defeated**.

### Ways in which the password could be obtained

- social engineering 
- eavesdropping 
- obtaining a dump of passwords that were previously compromised 
- bruteforcing weakly hashed passwords 
- admin accounts having default credentials which doesn't get changed
