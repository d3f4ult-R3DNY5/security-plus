### Code Reuse
---
>[!note]
> - Many organizations reuse code by making **use of third-party software libraries and software development kits** (SDKs)
> - Security teams should ensure that **outsourced code is subjected to the same level of testing** as internally developed code.
> - Security teams should be familiar with the various ways that the third party code is used in the **organisation**
