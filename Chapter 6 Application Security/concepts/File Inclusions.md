## File Inclusions

### Types of file inclusions 
---
- [local file inclusion](local%20file%20inclusion.md)
- [remote file inclusion](remote%20file%20inclusion.md)

The inclusion attacks are very dangerous as they often try to **exploit it to open a webshell on the server** and view the results on the browser.

This is harder to detect also.
