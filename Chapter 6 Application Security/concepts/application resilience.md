### application resilience
---
>[!note]
>When we design applications, we should create them in a manner that makes them **resilient in the face of changing demand**
>- **scalability :** That applications should be designed so that computing resources they require may be incrementally added to **support increasing demand.** 
>- **elasticity :** This goes a step further than scalability and says that applications should be able to **provision/deprovision resources automatically**
