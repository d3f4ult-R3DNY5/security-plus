## Sandboxing 
---
>[!note]
>Sandboxing is the practice of running an **application in a controlled or isolated environment** to prevent it from interacting negatively with other system resources or applications.

Helps in 
- **mitigating the impact of any potential threats or vulnerabilities** that result due to the application 
- operating under **restricted controls**
- reduces the possibility of a **malicious application or a compromised one from causing broader damage** to the system.
- testing out **new or untrusted code**
