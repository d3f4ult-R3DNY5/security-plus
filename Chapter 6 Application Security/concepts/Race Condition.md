### Race COndition
---
>[!note]
>Race conditions occur when the security of a code segment depends upon the **sequence of events occurring within the system**

These are 3 terms important to race condition 
- **Time-of-Check (TOC) :** is the instance **when a system verifies  access permissions or other security controls.**

- **Time-of-Use (TOU) :** is the moment when the system **accesses the resource or uses the permission that was granted**

- **The Target of Evaluation (TOE) : ** refers to the particular component, system, or mechanism being evaluated or tested for potential vulnerabilities

>[!warning]
>- A Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTTOU or TOC/TOU) issue is type of race condition that occurs when a program **checks access permissions too far ahead of a resource request.**
