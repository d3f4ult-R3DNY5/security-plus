## Secure Coding Practices

Given below is some of the measures that can help and mitigate with the secure coding practices of the organisation 

### 1. Source Code Comments 
---
Comments are an important part of any good developer's workflow. They help developers understand what the current piece or the logic of the code and support the documentation 

[Source Code Comments](../concepts/Source%20Code%20Comments.md)

### 2. Error Handling
---
**Attackers thrive on exploiting errors in code**. Developers must understand this and write their **code so that it is resilient to unexpected situations**

[Error Handling](../concepts/Error%20Handling.md)

### 3. Hard Coded Credentials 
---
In some cases developers **may include usernames and passwords** in the source code. 

[Hard Coded Credentials](../concepts/Hard%20Coded%20Credentials.md)

### 4. package Monitoring 
---
Modern development environments often rely heavily on third-party libraries and packages. Developers often use them to **save time and effort, but this practice can introduce vulnerabilities** if those libraries contain **insecure code or become compromised.**

[Package Monitoring](../concepts/Package%20Monitoring.md)

### 5. Memory Management 
---
Memory Management : Applications are often responsible for managing their own use of their own memory 

[Types of Poor Memory Management](../concepts/Types%20of%20Poor%20Memory%20Management.md)

### 6. Race Conditions 
---
Race conditions occur when the security of a code segment depends upon the sequence of events occurring within the system

[Race Condition](../concepts/Race%20Condition.md)

### 5. Unprotected API
---
Organizations often want other developers to build on the platforms that they have created. To enable this type of innovation, **services often create application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable automated access.**

Therefore **there is a need to secure these API**
