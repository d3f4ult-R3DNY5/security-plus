## Software Security Testing
---
No matter how well talented the development team for an application is, **there will be some form of flaws in the code.** Therefore the becomes a need to include **Software Security Testing** 

### Analysing the test Code
---
The source code that is the basis of every application and program has many flaws from **syntax errors to BO error or logical error to error handling** . Therefore there is need to understand the code 
- behaviours 
- expected responses 
- what the program does 

There are mainly 3 types of code analysis 
1. [Static Code Analysis](../concepts/Static%20Code%20Analysis.md)
2. [Dynamic Code Analysis](../concepts/Dynamic%20Code%20Analysis.md)
3. [Fuzzing](../concepts/Fuzzing.md)
