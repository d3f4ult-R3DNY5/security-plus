### Exploiting the authorization vulnerabilities
---
This allows the attackers to exceed the level of access they are authorised

### Insecure Direct Object Reference 
---
>[!info]
>web developers design an application to directly retrieve i**nformation from a database** based on an argument provided by the user in either a query string or **a POST request**

### Directory Traversal 
---
>[!info]
>Web servers suffer from a security misconfiguration that allows users to navigate the directory structure and access files that should remain secure.

[Directory Traversal](../concepts/Directory%20Traversal.md)


### File Inclusions 
---
>[!note]
>This takes the directory traversal to a whole another level. Instead of simply retrieving the file from the local OS the attacker tries to execute the code contained within the file.

### Privilege Escalation
---
>[!note]
>This aims to increase the level of access that an attacker has on a target system **. They exploit vulnerabilities that allow the transformation of a normal  user account into a privileged or SU account**
