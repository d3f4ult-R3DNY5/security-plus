## Software assurance best practices 

### Understanding SDLC
---
>[!info]
> Software is present from the customer-facing applications and services to smaller program. The process of **designing, creating, maintaining and supporting that software is part of the software development life cycle**

### Devops vs DevSecOps
---
Devops combines software development and the IT Ops with the goal of optimising SDLC. This is part of the CI CD  framework 
- CI : Continuous Integration
- CD : Code Deployment Framework 

DevsecOps takes the task one step further by implementing security in the devops model

### Designing and Coding for security 
---
While designing the applications or the services we must all consider the security as a part of the requirements process. This could be 
- **secure coding techniques**
- **code review**
- **testing** 

>[!caution]
>Fully integrated software can be tested using tools like web **application security scanners or penetration testing techniques**


### Secure Coding Practices 
---
One of the best resources for secure coding practices **is the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)**

>[!info]
>OWASP is the home of a **broad community of developers and security practitioners** and it hosts many community-developed **standards, guides, and best practice documents**, as well as a multitude of open source tools.
