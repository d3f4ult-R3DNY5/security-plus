### Exploiting Web App Vulnerabilities
---
Web applications are **complex ecosystems consisting of application code, web platforms, operating systems, databases, and interconnected application programming interfaces (APIs)**.

Due the vast attack surface attackers seem to target the systems with the goal to exploit the vulnerabilities present in these systems 

Given below is some of the vulnerabilities faced by web apps

### 1. Cross site scripting
---
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when web applications allow an attacker to perform HTML injection, **inserting their own HTML code into a web page.**
