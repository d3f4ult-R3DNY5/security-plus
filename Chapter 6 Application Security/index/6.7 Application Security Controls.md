## Application Security Controls 
---
Using a combination of **secure coding practices and security infrastructure tools**, cybersecurity professionals can build robust defenses against application exploits.

### 1. Input validation
---
Applications that **allow user input should perform validation** of that input to reduce the likelihood that it contains an attack.

[Input validation](Input%20validation.md)

### 2. WAF
---
Web application firewalls (WAFs) also play an important role in **protecting web applications against attack**.

[Web Application Firewalls](Web%20Application%20Firewalls.md)

### 3. Parameterised Queries 
---
Parameterized queries offer another technique to protect  applications against **injection attacks**

[Parameterized queries](Parameterized%20queries.md)

### 4. Sandboxing 
---
Sandboxing is the practice of running an **application in a controlled or isolated environment** to prevent it from interacting negatively with other system resources or applications.

### 5. Code Security 
---
Software developers should also take steps to safeguard the creation, storage, and delivery of their code. They do this through a variety of techniques.
