## Injection Vulnerabilities
---
>[!note]
>Injection vulnerabilities are among the primary mechanisms that attackers use to **break through a web application** and **gain access to the systems** supporting that application.

>[!example] Process
> Supplying some type of **code to the web applications** and gain access to the supporting system
