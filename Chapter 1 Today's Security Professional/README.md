### **Summary**
---

Cybersecurity focuses on protecting the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** (CIA triad) of information and systems.

- **Confidentiality**: Stop unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized or accidental changes to data or systems.
- **Availability**: Ensure data and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.

Analysts protect these goals by assessing risks and applying a mix of **security controls**:

- **Control categories**: managerial, operational, technical, physical.
- **Control types**: preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, compensating, directive.

**TL;DR**  
CIA triad = Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.  
Use varied controls from different categories and types to reduce risks.


### Key exam objectives
---
**Core Objectives (CIA Triad + Nonrepudiation)**

- **Confidentiality**: Block unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized or accidental changes to data/systems.
- **Availability**: Ensure data/systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.
- **Nonrepudiation**: Prevent denial of actions; proven with tools like digital signatures.

**Security Controls**

- **Categories**: Managerial, Operational, Physical, Technical.
- **Types**: Preventive, Detective, Corrective, Deterrent, Compensating, Directive.

**Data Breach Impact**

- **Direct**: Incident response costs.
- **Indirect**: Long-term reputation and operational damage.

**Data Protection States**

- **In Transit**: Protect with encryption to prevent eavesdropping.
- **At Rest**: Encrypt stored data to prevent theft.
- **In Use**: Secure during processing.

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**

- Stops unauthorized data exfiltration.
- Works at host level (agent-based) and network level (monitoring transmissions).
- Uses pattern matching or digital watermarking to detect sensitive data.

**Data Minimization**

- Reduce stored sensitive data to lower risk.
- If data must be kept, protect with deidentification or obfuscation: hashing, tokenization, masking.

**TL;DR**  
- CIA + Nonrepudiation = core security goals.  
- Use varied control categories/types to mitigate risks.  
- Encrypt data in transit, at rest, and in use.  
- DLP blocks leaks; data minimization lowers exposure.
