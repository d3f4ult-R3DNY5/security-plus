## **Data Protection**
---
Security professionals spend significant amounts of their time focusing on the protection of sensitive data.

The data can exist within 3 states 
- data at rest 
- data in transit
- data in use 

##### Data at rest 
>[!note]
> This type of data is stored on hard drives, tapes or even in the cloud infrastructre 

##### Data in transit 
>[!note]
> This type of data is in motion or transit over the network . When the data travels on an untrusted network 

##### Data in use 
>[!note]
>When the data is actively used by the computer system , Like the data that is present within the memory

### Data encryption 
---
Encryption is a technology that uses a mathematical algorithm to protect the information from the prying eyes of the user

### Data loss prevention 
---
Help organisation enforce the in information handling policies and procedures to prevent data loss and theft. 

composed of 2 environments 
- Agent based DLP 
- Agent-less based DLP 

##### 1. Agent based DLP 

Overview 
Software agents installed on systems that search those systems for the presence of sensitive information

Features 
- monitor system configs and block user actions 
##### 2. Agentless DLP

Overview 
Are dedicated services that sit on the network and monitor the network traffic watching for unencrypted communication 

DLP has two mechanisms of action which is given in the following file 

[DLP mechanism of action](DLP%20mechanism%20of%20action.md)

### **Data minimization**
---

>[!tip]
>Simple to understand that is to reduce the risk by reducing the amount of sensistive information

>[!note]
>This involves a crutical process that is known as deidentifcation that removes the traceback ability.

There are several approaches to the data obfuscation techniques 
[tools involved in obfuscation](tools%20involved%20in%20obfuscation.md)


### **Access restriction**
---
>[!info]
>security measures that limit the ability of individuals or systems to access sensitive information or resources.

There are basically two types of access restrictions that is involved 

#### 1. geographic restriction 
This limits the access to resources based on the physical location of the system .
>[!example]
>The users that are are located only within that region or country have access to the systems resources or region 


#### 2. Permission restriction 
This limits the user activity within the organisation based on a users role or authorization 



### Segmentation and Isolation 
---
Organization may also limit the access to the sensitive systems based on their network location 
#### 1. segmentation 
---
>[!info]
>This means placing the systems and technology on a seperate network so that they can communicate  with the systems on the same network but cant communicate with the systems that is present outside the network 

#### 2. isolation 
---
>[!info]
>Completely cuts of the system from the organisations networks
