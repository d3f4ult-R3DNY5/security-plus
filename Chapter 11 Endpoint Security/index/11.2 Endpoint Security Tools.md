## Endpoint Security Tools

Once a system is running, **ensuring that the system itself is secure is a complex task**. There are many types of security tools that is used to achieve these tasks 

### Anti malware and Antivirus tools

>[!note]
> One of the most common security tools is antivirus and antimalware software on the systems
