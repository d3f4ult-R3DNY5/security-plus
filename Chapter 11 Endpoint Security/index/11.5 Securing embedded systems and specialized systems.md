## Securing embedded systems and specialized systems
---
**Specialized systems continue to be built into everything** from appliances, to buildings, to vehicles, and even clothing, **the attack surface for organizations is growing in new ways.**

### SCADA AND ICS 
---
Industrial and manufacturing systems are often described using one of two terms.
- ICS : Industrial controls systems
- SCADA : Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

### Securing the IoT
---
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a broad term that describes network connected devices that are used for **automation, sensors, security, and similar tasks.**

### Communication considerations 
---
Many embedded and specialized systems operate in environments where traditional wired and wireless networks aren't available.

### Security Constraints of the embedded system 
----
Embedded systems have a number of constraints that security solutions need to take into account. Since the embedded systems have limited capabilities , deployments and lifecycles , The following measures must be taken into acccount while designing security for the embedded systems
