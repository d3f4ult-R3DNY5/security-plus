### Hardening Techniques 
---
Ensuring that a system has **booted securely is just the first step in keeping it secure. Hardening endpoints and other systems relies on a variety of techniques that protect the system and the software that  on it.**

### Hardening
---
Hardening a system or application involves changing settings on the system to **increase its overall level of security and reduce its vulnerability to attack.**

### Service hardening 
---
One of the fastest ways to decrease the attack surface of a system is to reduce the number of **open ports and services that it provides by disabling ports and protocols**

### Network Hardening 
---
A common attack surface that is easily exploited is the network

### Default password
---
A common issue is the use of default credintials or passwords while communicating with the network 

### Removing the unecessary Software 
---
>Another key practice in hardening efforts for many systems and devices is removing unnecessary software. While **disabling services ports, and protocols can be helpful, removing software that isn't needed removes the potential for a disabled tool to be reenabled**

Many system arrive with [bloatware](../../Chapter%203%20Malicious%20Code/concepts/bloatware.md) So its necessary to remoce them
