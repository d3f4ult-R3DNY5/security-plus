### Retention

- Retention may be legally **mandated with defined retention periods.**
- Legal holds can **require data preservation for ongoing or potential cases.**
- Retention may also **support business, compliance, or audit needs.**
- Disposal processes must align with **retention policies and data classifications.**
- Assets under retention must be preserved; expired assets must be securely disposed of.
- Keeping data longer than necessary increases risks such as breaches or legal exposure.
