## Firmware attacks
---
>Firmware attacks may occu**r through any path that allows access to the firmware.** That includes through **executable updates, user downloads of malicious firmware that appears to be legitimate, and even remote   network-enabled updates for devices** that provide networked access to their firmware or management tools.


>[!warning]
>A main concern is reinstalling the OS doesnt remove the malware that is embedded in the firmware
