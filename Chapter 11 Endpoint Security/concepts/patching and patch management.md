### patching and patch management
---
>[!note]
>Ensuring that **systems and software are up to date helps ensure endpoint security by removing known vulnerabilities.** Timely patching decreases how **long exploits and flaws can be used against systems, but patching also has its own set of risks.**

>[!important]
>- A significant of software is includes suites and other packages that are built into it that have to be maintained  
>- These tools **check for an update and either notify the user requesting permission to install the updates or automatically install the update**


This in Windows is done through the Microsoft's Config manager

---
>common practice for many organizations is to delay the installation of a patch for a period of a few days from its release date. That allows **the patch to be installed on systems around the world, hopefully providing insight into any issues the patch may create**
