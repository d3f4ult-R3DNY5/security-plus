## Decomissioning of Assets
---
>[!note]
>Decommissioning typically **involves removing a device or system from service, removing it from inventory, and ensuring that no sensitive data remains on the system**


### Practices 
---
- ensuring that the **storage media or disk is completely wiped out** 
- wiping the media 
- destroying the data 
- wiping tapes and other **magnetic media using a degausser** 
- Ovewriting of the data on the disks **using Darik's Boot and Nuke** 
- The **built-in secure Erase command for drives like these can help make sure remnant data is not an issue.**
- **Shredding, pulverizing, or incinerating drives so that no data could possibly be recovered is an option**
- Certification processes are used to document that assets were decommissioned
