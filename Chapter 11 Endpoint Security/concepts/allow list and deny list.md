## allow list and deny list
---
>[!note]
> - Allow list tools allow you to build a **list of software, applications, and other system components that are allowed to exist and run on a system**.
> - If not present in the list then it gets removed 
> - Block lists, or deny lists, are **lists of software or applications that cannot be installed or run**
> - The choice between the solutions depends on what **administrators and security professionals want to accomplish**
> - If the system contains highly sensitive data then **an allow list should be preffered**
