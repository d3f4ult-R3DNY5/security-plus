## Hardware Vulnerabilities
---
>Endpoints also face hardware vulnerabilities that require **consideration in security designs**. While this may be challenging to address all the vulnerabilities it is better to ensure compensating controls so that the impact of the security incident can be reduced 

### Firmware 
---
Firmware is the **embedded software that allows devices to function**. It is tightly **connected to the hardware of a device and may or may not be possible to update depending on the design and implementation of the device's hardware.**
**Computer and mobile device firmware is typically capable of being updated** but may require **manual updates rather than being part of an automated update process.**

### EOL systems and services 
---
End of life legacy systems and service is major concern primarily due to **lack of support that was provided originally by the vendor**. Without further updates or fixes the systems . Security updates wont be pushed further out so , They will have have to be isolated from the public facing network 


### Protecting the endpoints 
---
Security professionals will be asked to **recommend, implement, manage, or assess security solutions** intended to protect desktops mobile devices, servers, and a variety of other systems found in organizations.
