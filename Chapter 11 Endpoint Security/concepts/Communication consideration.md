### Communication consideration
---
>Many embedded and specialized systems operate in **environments where traditional wired and wireless networks aren't available.** As a security professional you will need to **account for the connectivity that is used in the embedded systems** 


### Cellular Technology
---
Cellular connectivity, including both existing **LTE and other fourth- generation technologies as well as newer 5G network connectivity**, can provide **high-bandwidth access to embedded systems in many locations where a Wi-Fi network wouldn't work.**

>[!important]
>- Since the third party users are responsible for providing with the cellular connectivity . They must be made secure to ensure a smooth operation 


### Securing Cellular networks 
---
- Physically securing the **subscriber identity module (SIM)**

>[!Danger]
>The biggest threat to the cellular sim industry is the attacks that involve sim cloning 


### Zigbee for communication 
---
Embedded systems may also take advantage of radio frequency protocols specifically designed for them.
- This provide **low-power, peer-to-peer communications for devices that don't need the bandwidth and added features provided by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth**
- Has limitatation on the range and the data rate that is being transferred
