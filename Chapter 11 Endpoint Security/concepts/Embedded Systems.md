## Embedded Systems
---
>[!note]
>- Embedded systems are computer systems that are built into other devices. 
>- Embedded systems are often **highly specialized, running customized operating systems and with very specific functions and interfaces** that they expose to users.

>[!important]
>- Many embedded systems use a real-time operating system (RTOS).
>- RTOS is a system that is used **when the priority is made to process the data as it comes in and not relying on other devices** 

### Assessing the embeded systems 
---
>[!FAQ] Questions to ask ?
>- Identify the manufacturer or type of embedded system and acquire documentation
>- How it connects to the outside world and how it sends data and through where and what network ?
>- If the device does provide the connection identify the device and the services or access to the device 
>- how the device gets patchess and if the patches are available and how and when do these patches need to be installed on to the system?
>- Document what your organization would do in the event that the device has a security issue or compromise.
