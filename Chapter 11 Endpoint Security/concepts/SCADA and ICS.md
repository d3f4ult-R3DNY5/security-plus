### SCADA and ICS
---
>[!note]
>Industrial controls systems (ICSs) is a broad term for industrial automation, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition is SCADA


### About SCADA 
---
>[!note]
>SCADA is a type **of system architecture that combines data acquisition and control devices, computers, communications capabilities, and an interface to control and monitor the entire architecture**.

### Working of a SCADA system

>- You'll see that there are **remote telemetry units (RTUs) that collect data from sensors**
>- **programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that control and collect data from industrial devices like machines or robots.**
>- This data is then sent to the system control and monitoring system that allows the them to see and run the SCADA system as per their interfaces 

### Use cases 
---
ICS and SCADA can also be used to control and manage facilities, particularly when the facility requires management of things like **heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to ensure that the processes or systems are at the proper temperature and humidity.**


### Security 
---
The securty to maintain these systems is quite complex as the systems itself is difficult to assess .
- realy depends on devices how they commuincate and identify potetial threats
