### Different types of viruses according to their behaviours 
---
- **Memory-resident viruses,** which remain in memory while the system of the device is running.
- **Non-memory-resident viruses**, which execute, spread, and then shut down
- **boot sector viruses** which reside in the boot sector of the drive on a storage media 
- **macro viruses** which use embedded macros 
- **fileless viruses**: attacks are spread through emails or through vulnerabilities through the browser plugins and web browsers 
	- they inject themselves into memory
	- have  the ability to reinfect the system via the same process at reboot through a Registry entry

### Defense strategies 
---
>[!tip] 
>- using antimalware tools to detect **malicous activities within powershell**
>- NIDS 
>- prevent browsing to **malicous sites** using using reputation based protection systems 
>- awareness training 
>- Tools to remove viruses from the memory 

>[!warning]
>In cases where the Viruses are resident on **the BIOS or UEFI systems** 
>A complete wipe and **reinstallation or reImaging** of the systems will ensure the the malware is gone
